## hacker-friendly-app

This web app, using Firebase, aims to demonstrate common Firebase security flaws by creating a hack-prone app. It has goals for noting and increasing awareness of often overlooked Firebase security risks and teaching some methods of spotting and countering them.

Advanced sections and demos will indicate using Firebase Custom Claims and the Firebase Admin for increased Firebase security.
